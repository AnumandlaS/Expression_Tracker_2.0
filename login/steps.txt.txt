1.In mongodb we need to create a collection in existing database for storing credentials of admin and child
2.I've created the collection called userauth
3.No changes in .env file
4.We need to add a new schema which you can find in schema.js
5.run npm install bcrypt in backend terminal
6.Coming to the username and passwords I've hardcoded it in index.js to store them in db...which is commented out...After you get the data in collection ensure that it's commented again
7.password is stored in bcrypt hash type in the database
