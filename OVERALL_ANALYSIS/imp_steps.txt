In this overall analysisi folder what all changes are done are listed here :
-> added a background image
-> Analysis part finished where we display the table of session ids, names,data,time
(once when you click on the session id button if the analysis is not already existing then it makes call to the model , if nnot it derectly 
navigates to the next page ) note: if analysis is not there and when you click on the session id button it will not be that fast 
you should click the button 2 or 3 times and then referesh it  after that it will navigate to next page (overal analysis)
-> overall analysis is almost done but the css part is not working properly
