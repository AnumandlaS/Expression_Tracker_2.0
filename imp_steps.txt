Your frontend will remain the same except for the game.js. See you need to make in game.js file in the repo.
Create a new backend folder which will consist of node_modules, uploads as usual and add db_connection file, schema file, server(basically index.js) file to it.
So whenever you run the backend the command goes "node server.js"
Commands:-
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express multer mongoose uuid
